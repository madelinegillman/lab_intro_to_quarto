## What is Quarto? {.incremental}

-   An open source publishing system

    -   Allows you to create cool dynamic content

    -   Make reproducible documents/publications that are publication quality

        -   articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub...

## Why Quarto?

::: incremental
-   A way to combine code + prose

    -   Multiple languages

-   Reproducible, support many output formats

-   Easily create presentation-ready documents that can be **easily updated** and shared

-   Can be a lab analysis notebook

-   You don't even need to know Markdown!
:::

## Creating an analysis notebook

-   The Quarto document can be used to run analyses---but I recommend keeping that in separate scripts.

-   A more realistic way for us to use Quarto in our lab: integrating data exploration, methods, and analysis choices to keep us organized and easily share with collaborators in multiple formats

## Creating an analysis notebook

1.  Open R Studio
2.  File -\> New File -\> Quarto Document
    -   Here, you'll be prompted to enter some metadata. This metadata will go in the YAML header (more on that later)

## Adding code chunks, images, links, and more

## Rendering

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown

-   Output from executable code

-   You may need to install a LaTeX distribution. You can install using R by running: `tinytex::install_tinytex()`

## Render options

![](images/render_opts.png){fig-align="center"}

## Getting fancy -- fonts

First, check which fonts you have available:

```         
# install.packages("systemfonts") 
fonts <- systemfonts::system_fonts() 
View(fonts)
```

Then, update your YAML with a font name under the `name` column:

`mainfont: ArialMT`

`monofont: Monaco`

## What you can use Quarto for starting today!

::: incremental
-   Lab notebook

    -   Read in results files and blend code, methods, analysis decisions, tables, plots, etc.

    -   Export output as pdf, html, or word doc

-   Create presentations

    -   Export output as html, pptx

-   Personal branding

    -   Resume

    -   Website

-   Writing papers (maybe)

# Git and Github

## What is git?

-   Git is a version control software

    -   Track and manage changes to code/software in a safe way

## Why use git? {.incremental}

::: incremental
-   Git is widely used across academia and knowing git is essential for any computational work in industry

-   Track changes (versions) of your code in an reproducible, open-source way

    -   Make and test changes while maintaining a "master" version
:::

## What is Github?

-   A **repository** hosting service

-   Free to have public repositories, paid account required for several private repositories

    -   You can get free GitHub Pro as a student

-   Another repository hosting service: Bitbucket

## Getting started {.incremental}

::: incremental
1.  Create a GitHub account
    -   Sign up for GitHub Educationt to access more features
2.  Link Longleaf with your GitHub account
    -   See [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

    -   You'll probably already have an existing SSH key
3.  Clone or initiate your first repository!
    -   `git clone <SSH_key_from_repository>`

    -   `mkdir <directory_name>`

        -   `cd <directory_name>`

        -   `git init`

    -   GitHub only allows letters, numbers, and the special characters "-", "\_", and "."

        -   So: no spaces, no #\$%\^&\*()\@!
:::

## A quick aside on what to use GitHub for {.incremental}

::: incremental
-   GitHub is not Google Drive

    -   If you try to add large files, you'll run into issues

-   GitHub is not a secure place to store data

    -   Especially for the kind of research we do, track scripts only

        -   You should be able to recreate all intermediate data files, plots, results, etc. using your scripts anyways!

-   Probably best to keep most repositories private (unless the repository has code you are intending to share such as as part of an open source tool or paper)

## Other things to mention on git

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Use `git status` in a repository at any point to see where things stand:

    -   Which files have changes but not staged?

    -   Which files are staged but not committed?

    -   Which files have no changes?

    -   What branch are you on?
